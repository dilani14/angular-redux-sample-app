# angular-redux-sample-app

This is a sample angular app for employee management which is integrated with [@angular-redux/store](https://github.com/angular-redux/store) library to manage app state.

This app has the basic functionalities as Adding Employees, Deleting Employees and Filtering Employees which are managed through the store.

This branch will contain the code related to the combine reducer concept where you can split your main reducer into small reducers where each reducer will take care of an independent portion of the app state

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
